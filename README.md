# Landing-Page
#### This was probably the most fun I had creating a web page so far. This project had a enough of a challenge without being really hard.

#### With the first project "Odin-recipes" I did use css flex, but without knowing what it was and how realy it is supposed to be used. When I used CSS-flex on that project it was quite confusing because I didn't knew what was happening and why it was happening.

#### But now having played with CSS-flex for a while, using CSS-flex in this project was pretty easy. Just by looking at the "prototype image" I had a understanding of where should I use flex and how to structure my html accordingly. And I was able to finish the entire project within about 2-3 hours.

## Important note

#### I used one of my hobbies(IEMs) mixed with a little humor as a idea for this website. The images(just one image, cropped into multiple parts) for this project was/were captured from squiglink.

#### Squiglink is a great site popular among headphone/iem enthusiasts to "see" how a heaphone/iem might sound and to EQ headphones/iems. It's Amazing and free.
